## about
I am a PhD Researcher at [City, University of London](https://city.ac.uk),
working in (bio)medical image analysis in cell tracking and shape analysis
at the Research Centre for Biomedical Engineering
[(RCBE).](https://www.city.ac.uk/biomedical-engineering-research-centre)
You can find my institution's website [here](https://goo.gl/yVQBfX).


## a brief background
I studied Applied Mathematics and Telematics Engineering at the
Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México [(ITAM)](www.itam.mx), in
Mexico City. I have always had many interests, which I have been
~~struggling~~ trying to juggle.
