I have collaborated on a number of projects. Here you can see the most often
reviewed and the most stable ones. However, feel free to dive into my
[github repos](https://github.com/alonsoJASL), you might find something of
interest there.

## Own
+ [Anglegram](https://github.com/alonsoJASL/matlab.anglegram) is a MATLAB software
  designed to analyse the shape of the boundary of binary objects through the 
  measurement of the inner angles in the boundary. We have developed anglegram 
  to detect junctions.

+ [macrosight](https://github.com/alonsoJASL/macrosight) is a MATLAB software 
  designed to analyse 3-layered images of macrophages moving. It uses the 
  [PhagoSight](https://github.com/phagosight/phagosight) algorithms and adapts
  it to images with overlapping cells. **Be careful, this is early development!**

## Collaborating
+ [PhagoSight](https://github.com/phagosight/phagosight), I collaborate
  often for this code, which analyses fluorescent microscopy time-lapse
  videos of neutrophils and other cells. You can read more about it 
  in [here.](phagosight.org)
